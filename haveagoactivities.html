  <div class="dogfetch">
    <h3>Fetch</h3>
    <p>Most dogs get fun and enjoyment out of a simple game of fetch. (Hounds and certain other breeds typically aren’t
      wild about it—too proud to fetch—but every dog is an individual.) Fetch has a triple function, actually; it gives
      your dog needed exercise, it helps strengthen the bond between you, and it gets him into the habit of returning to
      you.</p>

  <div class="dogswim">

    <h3>Swimming</h3>
    <p>Swimming is another great exercise for dogs. It’s low-impact, so it doesn’t stress the joints of older or
      arthritic animals. It also works many muscles at the same time. While not all dogs are natural swimmers, most can
      learn to enjoy it. </p>

  <div class="dogtraining">
    <h3>Training with agility</h3>
    <p>Dogs are natural hunters. While they may not have to hunt much further than the food bowl for their dinner, you
      can help them brush up on their skills of running through and jumping over a variety of obstacles.
